        <h3> HU Robotics club</h3>  
        <p>HURO - Howard University Robotics Organization. The biggest dilemma amongst college students is that we take in so much information in a short amount of time, and as a result we lose a lot of that information because there's no place to apply it. That's why the goal of HURO is to create an environment in which engineering students can use the information they learn in classes and apply it to hands-on projects. By doing so, we hope to increase the equity and skill of black engineers across the Howard University Campus. Join us in being the HUROs of Howard!</p>
